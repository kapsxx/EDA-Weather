The dataset used consists of 192 rows and 26 columns including features such as humidity, temperature, moisture, precipitation, CAPE, wind, solar radiation, sunshine, etc. The dataset contains records of all the mentioned features from 03-08-2020 to 10-08-2020 surveyed on an hourly basis. A brief analysis has been performed on almost all the features of the dataset and an informative graphical representation of the same is created using matplotlib. Along with the insights, brief and illustrative summaries are provided below each and every plot. The summaries include quick explanation of the attributes and their relationships with other features along with their impact on the climate.

The entire analysis along with the summaries are provided in the jupyter notebook attached.
